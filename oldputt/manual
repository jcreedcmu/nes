Stop! reading this manual booklette the backwards way! What
a foreigner you obvious! Where did you learn to read? In a barn, huh?!?
I thought about as much so. But I am serious now! The booklette
is printed in MANGA STYLE for the sake of more authentic reading
experience.

Welcome to the classic outdoor past-time. So relaxing. And so refreshing.
Next to a baseball, it is the most friendly with many people and the masses.
It is only Putt-Putt! You will most likely WATCH OUT FOR MISTER GIRAFFE!
He every time takes pleasure in the eating of a ball. He certainly
doesn't listen to mother's warnings!
